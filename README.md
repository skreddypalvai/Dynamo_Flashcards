### <u>Project Description:</u>
This project leverages a combination of frontend and backend technologies to effectively parse, analyze, and structure detailed YouTube transcripts. Upon providing a YouTube video link, the system utilizes the Google's Gemini LLM to extract key concepts from the video transcripts. Generated key concepts are then transformed into concise, accessible flashcards using LangChain, FastAPI, and Vite. This innovative approach revolutionizes study methods and significantly enhances the digital learning experience.
